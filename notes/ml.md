## Basics from Udacity Youtube Videos

### Naive Bayse

ex. Spam Mail Detector

### Gradient Descent

ex. Getting down from Mount. Height from ground. Goal is to get down easiest way. (Height is the error in Data Mining algorithms)

### Regression Linear

ex. Predict House prize based on other houses properties and prize -> Draw random line -> try minimize error using Gradient Descent (least square).

### Logistic Regression

ex. Divide two classes by a line -> random line til reduce sum of error with gradient descent (log lost method!)

### SVM (Support vector machine)

Like LR find the best divider. The line with maximum distance from the classes. -> Find maximum distance with Gradient Descent or other algothims!

### Neural Networks

Divide classes auto with weird shapes. (Is above Line1->TRUE | Is above Line2->FALSE ::-> TRUE ....)

### Kernel Method

Like LR when can't divide it in 2D. Add Z param so we can divide them with Surface in 3D.

```
[A(0,3),B(1,2),B(2,1),A(3,0)] -> add Z=xy -> (x,y,xy)
Or in 2D divide with curve y=1/x
```

### K-Means Clustering

ex. Know numbers of clusters = K. find K centers for K groups

### Hierarchical Clustering

ex. Like K-Means instead of K numbers of clusters, group objects with maximum distance that we defind, so we have unknown numbers clusters.
