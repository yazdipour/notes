# Questions

## Microsoft

### Phone Screen round

* What is your favorite technology and why?
* What teams at Microsoft are you interested in and why?
* How did you become interested in computer science?
* What is a linked list?
* What is your favorite language and why?
* (Explore) You work in an ice cream shop and step into the back for a few minutes. You return and see a large group of people waiting. How do you serve them?
* (Explore) How would you make a multimedia cookbook for a family of varying cooking skills and abilities?

### Explore - Dev questions (final rounds)

Cracking the Coding Interview is likely overdoing it, but good prep for future interviews elsewhere (note that Explorers interested in returning as a SWE Intern within the same team do not need to re-interview).

* What is the best data structure for a phone book with names and phone numbers? Code an example solution and explain.
* Print values in a doubly linked list in descending order.
* Invert a binary search tree.
* Sort an array, stack, and queue in arrays and linked lists.
* Write a program that returns the acute angle between two hands on a clock.
* Keep track of the positions of people in a line. (Note that some questions asked are intentionally vague; ask clarifying questions. Can we consider this a sorted list? I.e. are they allowed to move around or not? What does that movement look like? That detail matters.)
* Remove duplicates in this list.
* Reverse a string.
* Differences between a Binary Search Tree and Hash Table
* Write a function that merges two sorted Linked Lists
* Write some functions that traversed Binary Search Trees

### SWE Intern questions (final rounds)

Cracking the Coding Interview is good prep. Leetcode Hard is over-doing it.

* Given two integers m and n, loop repeatedly through an array of m and remove each nth element. Return the last element left. (If m = 7 and n = 4, then begin with the array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and remove, in order, 4 1 6 5 2 7 and return 3.)
* Given an array of 0's and 1's, move all of the 0's to the beginning of the array and all of the 1's to the end of the array. 
* Write a function that accepts an m x n matrix (array) of random numbers, and use the functions row (times) 2 and column-1 to set the entire array to 0.
* Solve a maze recursively.
* Solve the N Queens problem.
* Keep track of the X most recent entries to a list without duplicates (sometimes framed as a line problem).
* Find the longest palindrome in a string.
