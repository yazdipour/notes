# Computer Vision

## ImageNet Models

- Classic: LeNet5, AlexNet, ZFNet, VGG(Nice structure, Bad Memory usage)
- Inception: (Idea: use )
- ResNet

## Image Classification

A core task in Computer Vision

- Challenges: Illumination, Deformation, Occlusion, Background clutter, Intraclass variation
- Never use pure k-Nearest Neighbor on images. Cause: Distance metrics on level of whole images can be very unintuitive
